    title: 'Global Economic Summit Yields Surprising Results',
    excerpt: 'World leaders announce unprecedented cooperation agreement that could reshape international trade relationships.',
    content: `
      <p>The annual Global Economic Summit concluded yesterday with announcements that have sent shockwaves through international markets and diplomatic circles. World leaders from the G20 nations reached a comprehensive agreement on trade cooperation that many experts are calling the most significant economic accord since the Bretton Woods Agreement.</p>
      
      <p>The three-day summit, held in Geneva, brought together heads of state, finance ministers, and central bank governors to address pressing global economic challenges including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and sustainable development financing.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Agreement Points</h3>
      <p>The landmark agreement includes several groundbreaking provisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified Digital Currency Framework:</strong> A coordinated approach to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)</li>
        <li><strong>Green Trade Incentives:</strong> Preferential trade terms for environmentally sustainable products</li>
        <li><strong>Supply Chain Resilience:</strong> Joint strategic reserves and alternative sourcing agreements</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Transfer:</strong> Streamlined processes for sharing critical technologies</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>President Maria Rodriguez of the European Council stated: "This agreement represents a new era of international cooperation. We're moving beyond traditional trade barriers to create a more resilient and sustainable global economy."</p>
      
      <h3>Market Response</h3>
      <p>Financial markets responded positively to the news:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Global stock indices rose by an average of 3.2%</li>
        <li>Currency volatility decreased significantly</li>
        <li>Commodity prices stabilized across major markets</li>
        <li>Bond yields reflected increased investor confidence</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The agreement also establishes a new International Economic Coordination Council (IECC) that will monitor implementation and address disputes through diplomatic channels rather than trade wars.</p>
      
      <h3>Implementation Timeline</h3>
